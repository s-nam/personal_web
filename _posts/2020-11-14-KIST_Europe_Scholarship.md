"Korean Scientists and Engineers Association in Germany" (Verein Koreanischer Naturwissenschaftler und Ingenieure in der BRD e.V.) has awarded a scholarship to a few doctoral and post-doctoral researchers every year. A board of the award looks through applications and selects a limited number of applicants based on the excellence of achievements in their research field.

Out of 26 applicants, Saekwang has been selected as one of eight awardees for the scholarship this year! He would get the highest amount of scholarship (1000 EUR) sponsored by KIST Europe [^fn_1] from which only three awardees could receive.
