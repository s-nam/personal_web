I am honored to receive the best poster award in EuroHaptics 2020 Conference at Leiden, the Netherlands.

The title of the awarded poster is "Sweat softens the outermost layer of the human finger pad: evidence from simulations and experiments" and the authors are myself and Katherine J. Kuchenbecker.
