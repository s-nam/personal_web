## Saekwang Nam (남세광) | Tactile Roboticist

---

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in [Dexterous Robotics Group](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/dexterous-robotics) of Bristol Robotics Laboratory (University of Bristol), UK. I am working on developing and controlling a **tactile-based robot gripper** for dexterous object manipulation.

### **Tracing my life so far…**

---

I was born in **South Korea**. After high school, I could have a chance to **study in Japan** with government funding called the “Korea-Japan Government Scholarship Program.” Thus, I studied at Kanazawa University, majoring in mechanical engineering. While studying there, I decided to become a robot scientist who can understand both **mechanical engineering** and **computer science** fields. This passion led me to study computer science at the **University of California, San Diego**. Once the master’s course was over, I had to go back to South Korea to finish the mandatory military service. Alternatively, the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), one of the government-funded research institutes in Korea, hired me as technical research personnel (considered as a military servant). In **ETRI**, I developed several applications based on electroactive polymers and programs to actuate the polymers.

From Sep. 2017 to Oct. 2022, I studied as a Ph.D. student in the [Haptic Intelligence Department](https://hi.is.mpg.de/) of **Max Planck Institue for Intelligent Systems**. I was working on understanding the roles of moisture on the finger pad for stable object grasping. The project starts by looking at physical changes on the finger during the finger-object contact. On Oct. 12th, 2022, I successfully defended my doctoral dissertation and graduated from the Computer Science Department of the University of Tuebingen through [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/) doctoral program.
