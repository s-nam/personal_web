I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in [Dexterous Robotics Group](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/dexterous-robotics) of Bristol Robotics Laboratory (University of Bristol), UK. I am working on developing and controlling a **tactile-based robot gripper** for dexterous object manipulation.
